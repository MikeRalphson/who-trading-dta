The Doctor must be destroyed!<br>(The Tardis and her crew are there.)<br>DOCTOR: Earth is protected by me and my mates, this year and every other. Here we go!<br>(She sonicks off the forcefield and runs to our left while the others go right.)<br>DALEK: Exterminate!<br>(She slides up behind the Dalek.)<br>DOCTOR: Now attach the parts.<br>DALEK: Weapon failure.<br>YASMIN: The parts are on, Doctor!<br>DOCTOR: Get clear!<br>(The Dalek melts and explodes.)</p><p>367 minutes later</p><p><b>[Loading bay]</b></p><p>(The remains of the Dalek are being taken away.)<br>ARMEN: Is everyone all right in there?<br>RACHEL: We had an accident. People got hurt. The issue's been dealt with. There'll be someone waiting at Depository 23.<br>ARMEN: Long time since we opened that one. Whatever that is, is it safe?<br>RACHEL: Just get it there quick as you can.<br>ARMEN: Am I allowed to stop for a cuppa?<br>RACHEL: Oh, only cos it's you. How's your mum, by the way?<br>ARMEN: Yeah, you know...<br>RACHEL: Must be hard.<br>ARMEN: Yeah. Best get on the road.</p><p><b>[Layby]</b></p><p>(He's pulled the lorry in to refill his thermos at FI's Teas.)<br>ARMEN: Hi.<br>TEA LADY: Hi.<br>ARMEN: Can I get a cup of tea in there, please? Thank you.<br>TEA LADY: There you go, love.<br>ARMEN: Cheers.<br>TEA LADY: Have a good day.<br>ARMEN: Thanks very much. Have a good one.<br>(He walks back to his lorry, takes a drink, starts to feel dizzy, drops the thermos, collapses. The tea lady closes the serving hatch, drags his body and dumps it in the back of the lorry with the remains of the Dalek, then drives the rig away.)</p><p><b>[Empty lot]</b></p><p>PATTERSON: When you said breakfast meeting, I presumed it would be somewhere that served breakfast. Jo Patterson.<br>LEO: Leo Rugazzi. CEO, Rugazzi Technologies.<br>ROBERTSON: I acquired Leo's company 18 months ago.<br>(Arachnids in the UK...)<br>PATTERSON: I see you buying a lot of companies right now. They're calling you the American Mike Ashley.<br>ROBERTSON: There's a lot of value in the market today.<br>PATTERSON: Having your political ambitions ruined by that little toxic waste scandal seems to have been a blessing in disguise.<br>ROBERTSON: That's a very sensitive subject for me.<br>LEO: I just wanted to say that I am super-psyched about having a proper Technology Secretary at last.<br>PATTERSON: I was super-psyched too, until they told me that my budget was Â£2.70.<br>ROBERTSON: Well, if anybody can make it work, it's you, Jo.<br>PATTERSON: Show me why we're here.<br>ROBERTSON: Leo has something... revolutionary to show you.</p><p><b>[Overlooking a tunnel entrance]</b></p><p>(Angry mob facing a line of police in riot gear.)<br>ROBERTSON: Just a small role-play. We all know the problems facing the world today. Trust in our leaders is at an all-time low. Civil unrest is growing. Security budgets are falling. Our police forces are under pressure.<br>(Fire bombs are thrown.)<br>PATTERSON: Goodness, I hope no-one's going to get hurt.<br>ROBERTSON: The problem is obvious. Here's the solution.<br>(Out of the tunnel trundles a shiny new black Dalek. It surveys the situation and opens fire - with a jet of water.)<br>LEO: Built-in water cannon.<br>(What should be the sink plunger emits gas.)<br>LEO: And CS gas. We're not using actual CS gas.<br>ROBERTSON: I still think it would have been fine.<br>(The Dalek emits a highpitched noise. The 'rioters' clutch their heads in pain. The trio have ear defenders on.)<br>LEO: Sonic deterrent!</p><p><b>[Building]</b></p><p>LEO: Entirely robotic with an AI interface programme for every eventuality, thanks to extensive real-world scenario testing. Er, solar... solar powered with A-grade energy rating.<br>PATTERSON: You built this yourself?<br>LEO: Oh, pretty much. Er, once Mister Robertson became involved, he really helped us turbo-boost the whole project. Actually, talking about...<br>ROBERTSON: Er, she gets the picture, Leo. That's fine. This is a game-changer, Jo. It's the security equivalent of the iPhone.<br>PATTERSON: Shall we talk in private?</p><p><b>[Empty lot]</b></p><p>PATTERSON: I want them built and beta tested in my constituency.<br>ROBERTSON: Yes, yes, as discussed. When those car firms deserted you, I bought up all the plants. I own them now. So we repurpose, New infrastructure, new jobs. This is going to be a big win for you, Jo. A flagship policy from our dynamic new Technology Secretary, and it looks like, er, your party's going to need a new leader soon.<br>PATTERSON: What does he know, young Leo?<br>ROBERTSON: Only that I got the parts from some unknown source.<br>PATTESON: If it ever gets out that I tipped you off about advanced technology being transported from GCHQ...<br>ROBERTSON: It won't. We trust each other. This is a good arrangement, Jo. You're simply facilitating an acquisition and I'm cutting you in on the IP. Nobody knows. Everybody wins.<br>PATTERSON: How long will it take?<br>ROBINSON: Er, a year, give or take.</p><p>79 Billion light years away</p><p><b>[Prison]</b></p><p>(The cell is cut out of the asteroid rock, with lasers for window bars. The Doctor marks the new day with another scratch on the wall. She's been there quite a while. Her meal is transmatted in.)<br>DOCTOR: Urgh...<br>(The exercise symbol lights up so she walks down a corridor, following the flashing arrows on the wall.)<br>DOCTOR: Morning, camera 37. Morning, camera 38.<br>(Through a security door to a large area of individual spaces divided by energised fences.)<br>DOCTOR: Morning, Angela.<br>(She blinks and the Weeping Angel moves.)<br>DOCTOR: All right, Bonnie and Clyde?<br>(They are Ood.)<br>DOCTOR: Tiny! How many times? You can't eat the cage. Believe me, I've tried.<br>(It's a Pting. And back to her cell. Lights out.)<br>DOCTOR: Bedtime story, Doctor? Yes, please, Doctor. One of the classics? Ooo, yes, please. Settle down, then. (from memory) Mister and Mrs Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal...<br>(Banging on the wall.)<br>DOCTOR: What? Who's there? Stay strong. People are waiting for you.</p><p><b>[A Tardis]</b></p><p>(Graham and Ryan walk up to a detached house on a new estate. The door opens for them. It's the Tardis from Timeless Children.)<br>YASMIN: I keep thinking - she was barely in here for a couple of minutes and yet she coded the entry lock to our DNA, just like on her own Tardis. Maybe that's cos she wanted us to be able to follow her, to find her, cos she needed us. I'm going to work it out. I must be able to work it out.<br>(She's got a big board of clues.)<br>GRAHAM: Happy New Year, Yaz.<br>YASMIN: When was it New Year?<br>RYAN: You been sleeping in here?<br>YASMIN: Maybe.<br>GRAHAM: Yaz, you can't keep being here all the time. The Doc, you know, she went to do something she knew might kill her. We've just got to assume she didn't make it.<br>YASMIN: Why? Why do we have to assume that?<br>RYAN: Mate, we've been back ten months. We have to get on with our lives. That's what she told us. That's what she wanted for us.<br>YASMIN: But what if she needs us? How many times has she saved us?<br>RYAN: Yaz, face up to it, we don't know how to find her. All right? And there's something else. Graham, show her.<br>GRAHAM: Mmm-hmm. The Doc would really want us to keep an eye on the planet, right? Look, this is leaked online footage of what they're calling a prototype security drone. Apparently, this was taken over a year ago. Just watch.<br>YASMIN: That's a Dalek.<br>GRAHAM: Mmm-hmm.<br>YASMIN: But how's that possible?<br>RYAN: No idea.<br>GRAHAM: Watch.<br>YASMIN: Jack Robertson. Spider guy.<br>GRAHAM: Mmm.<br>YASMIN: He's in league with a Dalek?<br>RYAN: That's what we're going to find out.<br>GRAHAM: And that's what the Doc would do if she was here, so... are you with us?</p><p><b>[Woodland]</b></p><p>(It's raining.)<br>ROBERTSON: Well, it's an honour to be summoned by the Prime Minister in waiting... even if it is a bit, er, rural. How many hours till we get the results from the ballots?<br>PATTERSON: The numbers are on my side.That's why I wanted to talk.<br>ROBERTSON: You're not having doubts about our agreement, are you?<br>PATTERSON: Quite the opposite. I want to expedite our project.<br>ROBERTSON: Six of the sweetest words in the English language.<br>PATTERSON: I want an immediate national roll-out of security drones.<br>ROBERTSON: National? But we've only just started regional beta testing.<br>PATTERSON: And I want it at no cost to the British taxpayer.<br>ROBERTSON: Why, Jo, this is starting to sound like a shakedown.<br>PATTERSON: This country can be your shop window for global sales. Unless, of course, you'd like the Treasury to take a look at how much tax all your companies pay over here?<br>ROBERTSON: Ah. Well played... Prime Minister. Well played.</p><p><b>{Outside Robertson HQ]</b></p><p>ROBERTSON: (on phone) Leo? I'm outside. Three minutes.<br>RYAN: Yo. Remember us?<br>(Robertson assumes the position.)<br>ROBERTSON: Take the car! Just leave my face.<br>GRAHAM: What?<br>ROBERTSON: Oh, no. Not you guys.<br>RYAN: Yeah, us, cos we know all about you and that Dalek.<br>ROBERTSON: The what?<br>GRAHAM: The Dalek. The most deadly creature in the universe. We saw you with it.<br>ROBERTSON: What is this word that you keep using?<br>YASMIN: Oh, don't play innocent. Dalek. Whatever you're doing with it, we're going to stop you.<br>GUARD: Hands in the air! Step away from the car!<br>(Armed guards arrive.)<br>ROBERTSON: What, you didn't think I'd increase my security since the last time we met? You're lucky you're not all dead on the ground. Get rid of 'em, boys.<br>(Walking away.)<br>GRAHAM: Well, that didn't go exactly to plan, did it?<br>RYAN: I like that whole "whatever you're doing, we're going to stop you" vibe. Very Doctory.<br>YASMIN: Doesn't work when I do it. We didn't get anywhere near an explanation from him.<br>GRAHAM: If we had the Doctor's psychic paper or we knew how to work that Tardis, we could get into his office and see what's going on.<br>RYAN: Yeah, but we don't, so we're going to have to try and figure out another way.<br>GRAHAM: Yeah. This is hard, innit?</p><p><b>[Prison]</b></p><p>(The daily routine.)<br>DOCTOR: Morning, camera 38.<br>(In her exercise yard, she sees a Silent.)<br>DOCTOR: Oh, I forgot you were here.<br>HARKNESS: What about this face? Remember this?<br>DOCTOR: Jack. Jack!<br>HARKNESS: I knew you would look better in these colours than me. Hello, Doctor.<br>DOCTOR: What are you doing here?<br>HARKNESS: What do you think I'm doing here? Breaking you out. Temporal-freezing gateway disinhibitor bubble. Catchy, right? If it were me, I'd have called it a breakout ball. Freezes time temporarily, breaks through walls. Only problem is... it doesn't last long.<br>(He activates the bubble and steps through the electric fence to join her.)<br>HARKNESS: Hi!<br>DOCTOR: Have you had work done?<br>HARKNESS: You can talk! Now shut up and run.<br>(They run the bubble down the corridor.)<br>HARKNESS: I heard a rumour you were in here, so I committed a few crimes. Well, maybe a lot of crimes. Maybe more than I should have.<br>DOCTOR: What sort of crimes?<br>HARKNESS: Left turn.<br>DOCTOR: Oh!<br>HARKNESS: You're going to take the moral high ground with me when I'm breaking you out of prison? Be grateful!<br>DOCTOR: Front door! How long has this thing got left?<br>HARKNESS: 11 seconds till expiry! Go!<br>(They arrive in a room then the bubble expires.)<br>DOCTOR: Phew!<br>HARKNESS: Took 19 years to get to the cell next to you. Hope you had enough to occupy your mind.<br>DOCTOR: Too much.<br>HARKNESS: Here we go. One secretly stashed vortex manipulator.<br>(The alarms sound.)<br>HARKNESS: Wondered how long that would take. We need to go now.<br>DOCTOR: How did you manage to smuggle that in here?<br>HARKNESS: You really want me to answer that? Oh, I've missed you...very much. (hug) Let's go.</p><p><b>[Office]</b></p><p>(On the TV, BBC News reports Jo Patterson elected party leader and new Prime Minister.)<br>LEO: Operation, logistics and production have all been called in. Everyone has been told maximum capacity, maximum speed, and our beta partners are working through the night training staff, under our supervisors. All under NDAs, of... of course. We think we might have enough in place to... well, to make the deadline.<br>ROBERTSON: Great. Great job, Leo. This is going to be good for us.<br>LEO: I... I... I can't help but feel a little... well, you know, a little worried about the speed of this.<br>ROBERTSON: Everybody's worried, Leo. We live in uncertain times. Do you want to win? Embrace the uncertainty. Live in the worry.<br>LEO: Oh, okay. Er, so... so...there's... there's just something I... I needed to share on this project. When I first started working on that casing, I broke it down into the tiniest components. I made it my mission to, well, to understand everything about it.<br>ROBERTSON: Yes, and you did a great job. These machines are going to change the world.<br>LEO: I'm not talking about the machines. I'm talking about what was inside the original artefact.<br>ROBERTSON: There's nothing inside, Leo. It was a burnt-out shell.<br>LEO: Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. This granular investigation I've been doing, I... Well, I found something more. Organic remnants inside the machine. Tiny cellular traces scattered across the casing.<br>ROBERTSON: Where are you going with this, Leo?<br>LEO: Well... Look, I'll ju... I'll just show you.</p><p><b>[Laboratory]</b></p><p>LEO: Look. Just here, see? I.. I took the cellular traces and I... ..and I cloned them. Grew them. I grew a creature.<br>(A blobby thing with tentacles in a tank.)<br>ROBERTSON: Oh, my God!<br>LEO: It's beautiful, isn't it?<br>ROBERTSON: No! Are you insane? That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life. What were you thinking?<br>LEO: What? It's intelligent. I hooked it into the intra-neural network and... and there were flickers of activity. It understood our systems immediately.<br>ROBERTSON: You did what?! All right. Not another word. You've overreached, Leo. I want this incinerated immediately.<br>LEO: What?!<br>ROBERTSON: No argument!<br>(Grabs Leo's ear.)<br>LEO: Ow!<br>ROBERTSON: I don't want to see a trace of this. This never happened, you never showed it to me, this thing never existed. Do you understand?<br>LEO: Okay, okay.<br>(Lets go.)<br>ROBERTSON: You know what your problem is, Leo? You're too clever. This is why people don't like experts.</p><p><b>[Incinerator room]</b></p><p>(Which for some weird reason is upstairs...)<br>LEO: I'm sorry.<br>(He opens the mutant's box and it grabs him. Later -)</p><p><b>[Office]</b></p><p>LEO: Hi, love. It... It's me. I... I have to go on an urgent business trip tonight. Give the kids a kiss from me. Er... ..I'll call you when I can. Love you. Bye.<br>(Phone down.)<br>DALEK/LEO: Love you. Bye. Stand.<br>(It is on his back.)<br>DALEK: Good puppet.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: We're out. I'm back. My own Tardis. Captain Jack Harkness, gold star for rescuing.<br>HARKNESS: Told your friends if you ever need help, I'd be there. Wow. Nice upgrade in here. Which way's my room?<br>DOCTOR: You don't have a room. You've never had a room.<br>HARKNESS: I had a suite with its own cocktail lounge. They gave you my message, about the lone Cyberman? You didn't give it the Cyberium?<br>DOCTOR: It's a long story.<br>HARKNESS: What?<br>DOCTOR: I fixed it. Eventually. Just about. Sort of.<br>HARKNESS: Why were you in prison in the first place?<br>DOCTOR: Evading the Judoon. Twice at once. Then once I was in, they took 7,000 other offences into consideration.<br>HARKNESS: They stopped at seven?<br>DOCTOR: I was in prison for being me... right at the point when I wasn't sure what that meant. Ah, it's been a tough few decades.<br>HARKNESS: You're okay now, yeah?<br>DOCTOR: Oh, I guess we'll find out. Wakey-wakey.<br>(The Tardis powers up.)<br>HARKNESS: Hey!<br>DOCTOR: Nice nap? Thanks for waiting. I had a lot to think about in there. And three very special people I've missed.<br>HARKNESS: One of them was me, right?<br>DOCTOR: You never change.<br>HARKNESS: Wish I could say the same.<br>DOCTOR: Right. Find me my fam.</p><p><b>[Graham's home]</b></p><p>YASMIN: This is what I've got so far. Remnants of the Dalek we fought at GCHQ were cleared but then stolen. The driver is missing, presumed dead.<br>RYAN: Now Robertson's got his hands on it.<br>GRAHAM: Well, he can't have, because you sent that creature thing that was inside it into a supernova, so...<br>RYAN: Maybe there's more of them here on Earth, and one's got Robertson under their control?<br>YASMIN: Ryan, shh!<br>(Distant sound of Tardis materialisation getting louder. A wind blows as air is displaced.)<br>YASMIN: Please. Please be her.<br>(Tardis materialises, door opens.)<br>DOCTOR: Hi! I was in space jail.<br>GRAHAM: You what?<br>HARKNESS: Guess who got her out?<br>DOCTOR: You all met Jack, right?<br>HARKNESS: Hey, silver fox.<br>GRAHAM: (taking a step back) Hello.<br>YASMIN: We were worried about you!<br>DOCTOR: What? How long's it been? A week? Two weeks?<br>RYAN: Ten months.<br>HARKNESS: Er, whoops?<br>DOCTOR: No, it can't be. I set identical temporal coordinates to when I sent you back.<br>GRAHAM: Yeah, but your time machine ain't the best at running to time, is it, Doc?<br>DOCTOR: I'm sorry.<br>RYAN: Yeah, well, it's done now, so...<br>DOCTOR: Yeah.<br>HARKNESS: So... what's new on planet Earth?<br>FAM: Dalek.</p><p><b>[Osaka Japan]</b></p><p>(Leo uses a keypad and enters a building.)<br>DALEK: Forward. Further. Further.<br>LEO: What is this place? What have you done?<br>(Made a mutant cloning farm.)<br>DALEK/LEO: This is my project. This is what I have built.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: So, it looks like a Dalek, but it can't be a Dalek... unless it is a Dalek.<br>RYAN: Trust us. We've seen the footage.<br>YASMIN: If you scan for Dalek DNA trace across the planet...<br>HARKNESS: Oh, she's good.<br>RYAN: Yeah, we all are.<br>GRAHAM: So, you've had dealings with Daleks as well, then?<br>HARKNESS: Yeah, they killed me once, long time ago. No big deal.<br>RYAN: You look pretty healthy for a corpse.<br>HARKNESS: I know, right? I can be killed but I come back to life pretty quick. Partially her fault, partially a friend of hers on Earth called Rose. But she's trapped in a parallel universe now.<br>YASMIN: She's what?<br>DOCTOR: Dalek DNA trace, Japan. Osaka. Well, sort of. Not an exact match. Ah, it's corrupted. I can't quite make sense of it.<br>HARKNESS: I can check it out. Anyone want to come?<br>YASMIN: I will!<br>RYAN: I want a word with Robertson direct.<br>GRAHAM: Yeah, me too.<br>DOCTOR: Looks like he's recently opened a facility in Osaka. We could check it out, drop you on the way.<br>(Everyone grabs on to something as she activates the controls.)</p><p><b>[Robertson's office]</b></p><p>ROBERTSON: Everyone working at maximum capacity.<br>(The Tardis materialises outside his office door.)<br>ROBERTSON: Er... Let me call you back.<br>DOCTOR: If you're dealing with Daleks, you are way out of your depth.<br>ROBERTSON: What is that thing?<br>DOCTOR: I want to know what you're doing right now, and don't try calling security, cos I just blocked your phone lines.<br>ROBERTSON: What is the matter with you people? Hmm? Do you want to know what I'm doing? I'll show you myself.</p><p><b>[Factory floor]</b></p><p>ROBERTSON: Welcome to the production line.<br>DOCTOR: You're making Daleks.<br>ROBERTSON: We're 3D-printing security drones.<br>DOCTOR: What about what's inside?<br>ROBERTSON: There's nothing inside. It's run by artificial intelligence.<br>DOCTOR: What?<br>ROBERTSON: Watch. (opens a casing) See? They're machines. There's the remote signal unit.<br>DOCTOR: They're empty.<br>ROBERTSON: Mmm-hmm.<br>DOCTOR: You're messing with things you don't understand. The creature these are modelled on is the most evil killing machine in the universe.<br>ROBERTSON: You're getting much too excited about a bunch of 3D-printed shapes.<br>GRAHAM: So what are you doing at your facility in Osaka?<br>ROBERTSON: We don't have a facility in Osaka.<br>RYAN: Yeah, you do.<br>ROBERTSON: No, we don't! I would know.</p><p><b>[Osaka]</b></p><p>YASMIN: It says this is an agricultural park. Guess this is the future.<br>HARKNESS: Hmm.<br>YASMIN: Vertical farms. All inside.<br>HARKNESS: In my time, there are whole agri-planets that look like this, shipping food all over galaxies.<br>YASMIN: Your time?<br>HARKNESS: 51st century.<br>YASMIN: Get lost!<br>HARKNESS: Seriously. Boeshane Peninsula. Maybe one day I'll take you there.<br>YASMIN: Are they all like you there?<br>HARKNESS: No. I'm pretty special. Had a rough time, then? Without the Doctor?<br>YASMIN: I don't know what you mean.<br>HARKNESS: I saw the way you shoved her. You thought she wasn't coming back, right?<br>YASMIN: You're guessing a lot from a shove.<br>HARKNESS: I have my own experience with the Doctor.<br>YASMIN: I just missed her. I never stopped to think...<br>HARKNESS: Hey. When I was with the Doctor, I saw more than I could have ever dreamed. And then... we lost each other. I didn't know what happened to him. If he was alive or... if I was ever going to see him again. Hard way to live. Being with the Doctor, you don't get to choose when it stops. Whether you leave her or... she leaves you.<br>YASMIN: It felt cruel... to be shown something I couldn't have any more. Felt like, er, I'd rather not have known. I'd rather not have met her, cos having met her and then... being without her, that's worse. How do you deal with that?<br>HARKNESS: How many people in the universe get to meet the Doctor, let alone travel with her? We're the lucky ones, Yaz. Enjoy the journey while you're on it. Cos the joy... is worth the pain.<br>(Round the back of a building.)<br>HARKNESS: Locked door.<br>(Sonic gun cuts a square hole.)<br>YASMIN: Thanks.<br>(She goes through.)<br>HARKNESS: Thanks? That's it?<br>YASMIN: Are you feeling insecure? Cos you seem to need a lot of praise.<br>HARKNESS: Do I?</p><p><b>[Mutant cloning farm]</b></p><p>YASMIN: Through here. Those things. They were what was inside the Dalek we met.<br>HARKNESS: Inside every Dalek. This is a clone farm. They're not growing food here, they're... they're growing Daleks.</p><p><b>[Downing Street]</b></p><p>(The obligatory press statement outside No 10.)<br>PATTERSON: As your new Prime Minister, I can see great opportunities ahead for this country. We here in Britain, we've never been afraid of the future, but I do understand that what we all crave right now is security. Security in our politics, security in our jobs, security for our families. I pledge to bring stability and security to every aspect of our national life. Together, we can make this the age of security.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>ROBERTSON: What's happening here? What are we actually doing?<br>DOCTOR: Going to Osaka - fast!<br>ROBERTSON: What about...? What about this blue box? What is it? It's a... It's a doorway? It can't be. That was my hallway. I don't understand.<br>(The Tardis is in flight.)<br>RYAN: Should we explain it to him?<br>GRAHAM: Nah, it's more fun watching him struggle.<br>DOCTOR: As hard as it is for you to understand, this isn't about you. This is about Daleks.<br>ROBERTSON: Please stop using that word. It has no meaning.<br>DOCTOR: Yes, it does. To billions of people, Dalek means hate. Daleks are creatures of hate and aggression. Daleks are insidious, relentless and clever, and, like hate, they will spread if they're not stopped. Never underestimate a Dalek.</p><p><b>[Downing Street]</b></p><p>PATTERSON: Which is why I am unveiling today a very exciting, new solution to an age-old problem. We will harness the technological revolution to enhance your safety. We will alleviate pressure on police and security staff and all without draining the public purse.<br>(Four Daleks trundle into view.)</p><p><b>[Mutant cloning farm]</b></p><p>HARKNESS: Oi! Can you hurry up and help me with this?<br>YASMIN: I need to take a sample of the liquid. I want to know what it's being fed on. Might give us a clue on how to stop 'em.<br>HARKNESS: Huh. We're going to blow 'em up, kid. That's how we stop 'em.<br>(He sets explosives around the canister supports. But one mutant is out and on the move. Mucus drops, he looks up and it jumps onto his face. Alien!)<br>YASMIN: Jack!<br>(Another one leaps onto her back. Jack pulls the one off his face and blasts it with his gun.)<br>YASMIN: Get it off me!<br>HARKNESS: Stand still! Yaz, don't move!<br>(Blast.)<br>YASMIN: Nice shot.</p><p><b>[Downing Street]</b></p><p>PATTERSON: As of now, you will see new defence drones at work on Britain's streets, in our institutions, at our borders and national monuments.<br>(At the Tower of London.)<br>PATTERSON: These technological innovations are set to make Britain more secure.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>(Ryan puts on a beanie hat.)<br>DOCTOR: You do love a beanie. Me too. One of the first things I noticed about you that night we met. I thought, not everyone can carry off a yellow beanie. There's a lad to rely on. Four minutes to Osaka.<br>RYAN: Yeah. Okay.<br>DOCTOR: I'm sorry about the ten months. More sorry than I can ever really say.<br>RYAN: This thing, innit? You never really quite got the hang of it.<br>DOCTOR: I missed you all so much.<br>RYAN: Yeah? We missed you too.<br>DOCTOR: But you've been good?<br>RYAN: Yeah, maybe it's what I needed.<br>DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. Ah. Maybe it was.<br>RYAN: Hmm. I saw me dad.<br>DOCTOR: Oh, good. Well, was it good? He's all right?<br>RYAN: Yeah, he's back at the oil rigs again. Due back in a couple of weeks. But, yeah, we're good. We're getting there. Time to reconnect with him, time to see me mates, see what's happening on the old planet. Lots of work to be done here on Earth.<br>DOCTOR: Yeah. Always. Well, it sounds like you enjoyed being back.<br>RYAN: It's home.<br>DOCTOR: Yeah.<br>RYAN: What's happening with your home? You know, what happened to you on Gallifrey?<br>DOCTOR: All life there destroyed, thanks to the death particle and Ko Sharmus.<br>RYAN: And the Master? What did he want with you?<br>DOCTOR: It doesn't even matter now.<br>RYAN: No, no, no. Don't give me that. Right? I see what you're doing. You're trying to avoid the subject. We've known each other long enough now. I know when something's changed.<br>DOCTOR: Me too. I'm not who I thought I was, Ryan. What I always knew to be the story of my life... isn't true. I wasn't born on Gallifrey. Where I'm from, all the lives I've lived, some of that has been hidden from me, and I don't even know how much.<br>RYAN: Seriously? And how do you feel about that?<br>DOCTOR: Mostly... angry. While I was locked away, all I kept thinking was, if I'm not who I thought I was, then who am I?<br>RYAN: You're the Doctor. Same as before, same as always.<br>DOCTOR: Right. Same Doctor, same Ryan. Nothing's changed.<br>RYAN: No. No. I didn't say that, did I? Things change all the time, and they should, cos they have to. Same with people. Sometimes we get a bit scared, cos new can be a bit scary, right?<br>DOCTOR: New can be very scary.<br>RYAN: So, when we're done with this Dalek problem, you find out about your own life. Confront the new, or the old. And then everything will be all right.<br>DOCTOR: Will it?<br>RYAN: No doubt. What?<br>DOCTOR: Thank you, Ryan, for being my friend.<br>RYAN: Thank you for being mine.<br>DOCTOR: Always.<br>(Judder, materialisation starts.)<br>DOCTOR: Osaka.</p><p><b>[Mutant cloning farm]</b></p><p>HARKNESS: Oh-ho-ho!

But who built all this?!<br>DALEK/LEO: I have.<br>ROBERTSON: Leo?<br>DOCTOR: Don't get too close!<br>ROBERTSON: I warned you about that thing.<br>DOCTOR: What have you done, Leo? Cloned the smallest trace of organic material, not understanding that Dalek consciousness can live within the tiniest fragment of their DNA. You weren't to know. You're safe. We're here for you. We're going to get you out of here alive.<br>DALEK/LEO: You give this body false hope.<br>DOCTOR: All right, then, Dalek, or whatever you are, tell me how you've built all this.<br>DALEK/LEO: I connected myself into the neural network. I inserted myself into the organisation, into every network. I located this place, created it. Every piece of equipment, every idea behind it... I did that.<br>ROBINSON: Wait a minute. First of all, that's not possible. Where did you get the purchase order numbers in the first place?<br>RYAN: Really, that's what's bugging you most right now?<br>DALEK/LEO: I used your systems to buy this building, to order equipment, to pay humans to construct and to continue the clone work. I used your systems to build an army all in my image.<br>YASMIN: But where are the workers? Where are the people who did all the cloning?<br>DALEK/LEO: Once the experiments were working, they became... unnecessary. We found them another use.<br>HARKNESS: What, you're feeding cloned Dalek creatures liquidised humans?<br>DALEK/LEO: Correct.<br>ROBERTSON: This is a PR disaster.<br>DOCTOR: But there's something else that's bugging me. What is it?<br>YASMIN: Is it the light? The light's been changing really slowly ever since we've been here.<br>DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Thanks, Yaz. I missed you, Yaz. Right, why is that important? Oh, there's too much going on. Where was I? Yes. How are you going to get off this planet?<br>DALEK/LEO: We will not.<br>DOCTOR: I'm sorry?<br>DALEK/LEO: The planet is ours. It will be converted.<br>YASMIN: Converted into what?<br>DALEK/LEO: We shall use this planet as a base from which to conquer this sector of the universe.<br>DOCTOR: There's a long way between squatting in a Japanese lab and subjugating humanity. I mean, you don't even have bodies. What are you going to do, order people from your tanks? Even if you made it to those shells down there, which you can't. You can't. I mean, you definitely can't. The... Those shells aren't even weaponised. They're not proper Daleks. He built them.<br>YASMIN: Doctor, what's the matter?<br>DOCTOR: The light.<br>DALEK/LEO: The shells were built in his factories. Do you think I've not augmented those designs also?<br>DOCTOR: Where's the light? We have to turn off the light!<br>HARKNESS: Why, Doctor?<br>DOCTOR: Ultraviolet light. The Recon Dalek used it to come back together.<br>DALEK/LEO: Activate!<br>(All the clones vanish from their tanks.)<br>DALEK/LEO: My project shall be complete.<br>(And transmat into shells in labs.)<br>DALEK/LEO: The New Dalek Army shall have but one purpose.</p><p><b>[Research lab]</b></p><p>(The water jet is now an energy weapon.)<br>DALEK: Exterminate!

I do not have to, and yet...<br>(Zapping.)<br>LEO: I'm sorry.<br>ROBERTSON: Oh, Leo!<br>DOCTOR: No weapons. No time to think. All that time in a cell wondering who I am. I'm the Doctor.

Exactly!<br>RYAN: So, what is it you're going to do?<br>DOCTOR: They're built from the original Reconnaissance Dalek. I'm going to give them what they wanted in the first place.<br>YASMIN: What's she doing?<br>HARKNESS: Something you never want to do.<br>GRAHAM: Doc, what have you done?<br>DOCTOR: Sent a message through the timelines into the Vortex, cos I know they're in there, like sharks in water.

They're the enforcers of the Dalek race.<br>YASMIN: To combat Daleks, you've brought more Daleks?<br>DOCTOR: Yes, but they don't know that I'm behind the transmission, and it's quite important that they don't realise I'm here.
