Who's attacking us?<br>(Cybermen open fire, but get cut down themselves.)<br>HALAZ: Be careful.<br>ARNHOST: It's all right, they're dead.<br>HALAZ: Go through. Head down the train. There are more marshals. Secure passenger safety.<br>(The Cybermen begin to glow golden.)<br>HALAZ: What's happening to them?<br>ARNHOST: That energy... They're regenerating!<br>HALAZ: All frequencies... urgent appeal for help! Is there anyone out there?<br>DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, there is.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: We're unable to materialise inside your craft. The Cybermen have a blocking field in action.

You know what'll happen to them.<br>HALAZ: We have to protect the cargo. Keep moving!<br>(Cybermen shooting at them.)<br>HALAZ: Go with the passengers. I'll hold them off.<br>(She gets injured and grabbed.)<br>CYBERMAN: Where is the cargo?<br>HALAZ: There's no cargo on board this train.<br>CYBERMAN: You lie. Identify the location of the cargo carriage or be deleted.<br>HALAZ: I'm not afraid of the Cybermen.<br>CYBERMAN: We are more than Cybermen. We have evolved. We are your Cyber Masters.</p><p><b>[Spacetrain hull]</b></p><p>(The Doctor sonicks open a control hatch.)<br>DOCTOR: Okay, two important points. Number one: find something to hold on to. Number two: don't get shot!<br>DAN: What?!<br>(Dan gets hit and starts to float off before Yasmin drags him back down.)<br>DOCTOR: I'm going to deactivate the train's electromagnets.<br>YASMIN: But aren't they keeping us stuck to the roof?!<br>DOCTOR: Yeah, but not just us. Watch out!<br>(The Doctor holds Yasmin who holds Dan. The Cybermen go flying by.)</p><p><b>[Spacetrain]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: The train needs bringing under control. We need to get the train to a halt. The controls are over there, as I showed you. Don't lose my sonic. We need to find and keep the passengers safe and find out what those Cyber Masters want with this train.</p><p><b>[Cargo carriage]</b></p><p>CYBERMAN: Leader, the cargo has been secured.<br>LEADER: Open it.</p><p><b>[Spacetrain - front and middle]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: It's all right.

Pass that medpack off the wall.<br>DAN: All right, Dan, son, just like she showed you.<br>(The Spacetrain speeds up.)<br>DOCTOR: Dan?<br>DAN: Whoops, sorry! Wrong setting. Sorting it, hopefully.<br>(It slows down again.)<br>DAN [OC]: This is your space train driver Dan reassuring you everything is under control and we will be slowing to a gentle stop momentarily.<br>DOCTOR: I'll deal with the Cybermen.<br>ARNHOST: They're not ordinary Cybermen.<br>DOCTOR: I know.</p><p><b>[Cargo carriage]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: Get away from that pod.<br>CYBERMAN: Doctor, you shall not disrupt our mission.<br>DOCTOR: Oh, I think I shall. Feel that slowing down? This train's under my control and reinforcements will be here any moment. So whatever you came for, whatever that cargo is, you've failed.<br>(The cargo container opens. There is a child inside.)<br>DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be scared. I'm the Doctor. I'm going to protect you.<br>LEADER: The Doctor lies.<br>(The child and the Cybermen all transmat away.)</p><p><b>[Siberia 1916 - a house]</b></p><p>MESSENGER: Father Grigori, I have a message from the Tsarina. Your presence is urgently required at the Winter Palace. The Tsarevich has been taken ill.</p><p><b>[London 2022 - Art Gallery]</b></p><p>(Dorothy McShane takes a photo of an empty wall.)<br>ACE: Excuse me.<br>CURATOR: Can I help?<br>(A young woman, not The Curator.)<br>ACE: What's happened to this painting?<br>CURATOR: It was taken down for restoration work.<br>ACE: Was there something wrong with it?<br>CURATOR: No. From time to time, all the paintings need a little TLC.<br>ACE: But this one was only restored two months ago.<br>CURATOR: It required a little additional work.<br>ACE: Did it?</p><p><b>[Gallery cafe]</b></p><p>ACE: Fifteen of the world's most well-known paintings all been taken down pretty much simultaneously and with no explanation. Where are you, anyway?<br>TEGAN [OC]: Sorry, Ace. Say again?</p><p><b>[Countryside]</b></p><p>(Trying to get a signal.)<br>ACE [OC]: I said, where are you, Tegan?<br>TEGAN: What day is it, Thursday? Romania. Somewhere near the Carpathians or maybe in them. I'm losing track.<br>ACE [OC]: What are you doing there?</p><p><b>[Gallery cafe]</b></p><p>TEGAN [on phone]: There's a volcanic chain where those three seismologists were last seen investigating a nearby earthquake.<br>ACE: And did you find them?</p><p><b>[Countryside]</b></p><p>TEGAN: Disappeared off the face of the Earth, just like the others.</p><p><b>[Gallery cafe]</b></p><p>ACE: A dozen seismologists and paintings.<br>TEGAN [on phone]: There's something else.</p><p><b>[Countryside]</b></p><p>TEGAN: When I arrived at this cabin, there was a package waiting for me. When I opened it up, there was a Russian doll toy box inside. But there was also a card... from the Doctor. Ace, I haven't heard from the Doctor for nearly four decades.<br>ACE [on phone]: Yeah, all right, show-off!</p><p><b>[Gallery cafe]</b></p><p>ACE: Just cause it's only three decades for me. So what was the doll?</p><p><b>[Countryside]</b></p><p>TEGAN: A Cyberman! Of all the things, why would the Doctor send me that? That's not a fond memory.</p><p><b>[Gallery cafe]</b></p><p>TEGAN [on phone]: It's not even a Russian doll. And why send it to me now?<br>ACE: I think we should go in.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>(The Tardis materialises in the middle of Dan's street.)<br>DOCTOR: Back in time for your date. You're welcome. Should we pick you up again in 24 hours? Yaz, you and I can try and pick up the trail of where the Cyber Masters went with that child.<br>DAN: You don't have to come back for me.<br>DOCTOR: Okay.<br>YASMIN: What?<br>DAN: I was one hand away from flying off into space and suffocating. I don't want to push me luck any further. I mean, all this... All this is amazing, and I've had the most incredible time. But it's not my life. And my life's far from perfect, but... I need to get back to it. I need to attack it. And I can now... cause I've been with you.<br>DOCTOR: I get it. Life's important. Home's important.</p><p><b>[Granger Street]</b></p><p>(There's a gap in the terrace where Dan's miniaturised house is.)<br>DAN: Yeah. My house. Looks like I'll be kipping on my mum and dad's sofa tonight. See you again, Doctor.<br>(The Doctor goes back in the Tardis.)<br>DAN: Have I upset her?<br>YASMIN: Not one for goodbyes. Whereas me, I'm glad to see the back of you.<br>DAN: I'll call you.<br>YASMIN: I'll ghost you.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>DALEK: Doctor!<br>DOCTOR: No!<br>DALEK: Breaching transmission firewalls.<br>DOCTOR: Get out of my Tardis!<br>DALEK: I mean you no harm.<br>DOCTOR: You'd be the first Dalek to ever mean that.<br>DALEK: I have information critical to the future of both humans and Daleks. It is imperative that you and I meet immediately.<br>DOCTOR: I don't think so.<br>DALEK: I offer you the key to the destruction of the Daleks.<br>DOCTOR: A Dalek invades my Tardis with a message offering to destroy its own species?<br>DALEK: I no longer believe in the Dalek mission.<br>DOCTOR: Well, that's a new one.<br>DALEK: The Dalek machine was created to ensure the survival of the Kaled race. Yet Kaled identity has eroded over time. The Dalek mission has changed to become the perpetuation of the Dalek race. Analysis concludes we have lost the right to survive.<br>DOCTOR: Your Creator would both be impressed and horrified. So you come to me as what, a spy?<br>DALEK: A Dalek incursion on Earth is imminent. I offer you the chance to destroy every Dalek before that attack.<br>DOCTOR: Why would I ever trust you?<br>DALEK: To save the lives of billions of humans. I will communicate location and time. You must attend.<br>DOCTOR: No, no, no. You don't order me!<br>DALEK: I am detected. Transmission must end.<br>YASMIN: Who are you yelling at?<br>DOCTOR: The Tardis has locked on to the cargo trail. Now, where is that child? That data doesn't make sense. It's just outside Earth in the year 1916.<br>YASMIN: Why doesn't that make sense?<br>DOCTOR: Because I'm seeing one planet too many in your solar system. And that extra planet is right in the shadow of Earth.</p><p><b>[St Petersburg 1916 - The Winter Palace]</b></p><p>MAID: Tsarina, Rasputin approaches.<br>ALEXANDRA: It is good to see you, Father Grigori. How is my son?<br>MASTER: Such a tiny injury and such a terrible effect. His haemophilia is a cruel illness.<br>ALEXANDRA: I cannot help but think that he has worsened ever since the arrival of the second moon in the sky.<br>MASTER: An entire new moon. These special times must not challenge our faith. They should strengthen it.<br>ALEXANDRA: I'm afraid for my son.<br>MASTER: I believe in the morning he'll be much improved.<br>ALEXANDRA: But can you be sure?<br>MASTER: Are my eyes not full of certainty?<br>ALEXANDRA: Yes... they are.<br>MASTER: My dear Tsar, this endless war. Have you made your decision to send more troops or withdraw?<br>NICHOLAS: It is so difficult. What would your advice be?<br>MASTER: My main concern is that you and your family take some time away. A holiday, very soon, don't you think?<br>NICHOLAS: Long holiday? Yes. Yes, I, er... I think so. Don't I?<br>MASTER: I will take care of your beautiful Winter Palace and you will remain assured of your one certainty. Which is?<br>NICHOLAS: That you are the Master... and I will obey you.</p><p><b>[Cyberplanet]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: Organic life converted into metal on a planetary scale.<br>YASMIN: Cybertechnology.<br>DOCTOR: Are they capable of this? There's Cybermen everywhere we go right now, Yaz. Those ones on the train, the Cyber Masters, they were created by the Master on Gallifrey.<br>YASMIN: Doctor?<br>(There's another Police Box, but the writing on it just says Hahaha over and over.)<br>DOCTOR: Stay here.<br>YASMIN: Nope.</p><p><b>[Second Tardis]</b></p><p>(The Cloister bell is tolling.)<br>YASMIN: It's not yours, is it? Yours from another time? In the future.<br>DOCTOR: I feel like I'm being taunted. Ah! The core of this Tardis has been lashed into the centre of the planet's metal structure. But why?<br>YASMIN: The screen's showing another energy source on the surface.<br>DOCTOR: Come on.</p><p><b>[Cyberplanet]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: Ah, there's a rudimentary cloaking shield in operation. Soon fix that. The Cybermen have tethered that child into this planet. It was registering as an energy source.<br>YASMIN: How is that child an energy source?<br>DOCTOR: Wait, there's more layers to the shield. Oh, not just cloaking. It's a consciousness shield! A creature trying to evade capture, hiding behind a visual projection shield, and this one shows us what we instinctively want to protect, as a defence.<br>YASMIN: So what is it?<br>DOCTOR: Oh, a Qurunx. One of the great mysteries of the universe. I've never seen one before, Yaz. Sentient energy enough to power planets and civilisations. They're so rare. A metal planet with a Qurunx at the heart of it, on the edge of Earth in the second decade of the 20th century. Why?<br>LEADER: Desist!<br>DOCTOR: Ah, decided to show your face, have you? Is this planet your doing?<br>LEADER: This structure is the zenith of Cyberconversion. An entire planet transported here.<br>DOCTOR: You think I'm going to allow that?<br>LEADER: You will not be able to stop it.<br>DOCTOR: Oh, yeah? Why is that?<br>LEADER: Your Master awaits, Doctor.<br>YASMIN: Doctor, what does it mean by that?<br>(More Cybermen transmat in and start shooting. They run.)</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: Yes, what?<br>KATE [holo]: Doctor, UNIT needs your help.<br>DOCTOR: Bit busy, Kate. Can it wait? Oh! KATE [holo]: Absolutely not.</p><p><b>[UNIT HQ London 2022]</b></p><p>DOCTOR: Nice new building.<br>KATE: Thank you. Now, a dozen of the world's leading seismologists have gone missing in the past two weeks. Plus of the world's most valuable paintings have disappeared from view.<br>DOCTOR: That's what you called us here for? Have you any idea what's going on in outer space in 1916 right now?<br>KATE: Strangely enough, no. Oh, also new freelancers. Don't be cross.<br>ACE: Are you ready for this?<br>TEGAN: No.<br>ACE: Me neither.<br>KATE: I believe you three know each other of old.<br>ACE: Oh, wow!<br>TEGAN: You said a woman. You never said young.<br>DOCTOR: Tegan. Ace?<br>ACE: That is a good look on you, Professor.<br>DOCTOR: What are you doing here?<br>KATE: I brought them in. I'm rebuilding our intelligence networks with people who understand the problems Earth faces from personal experience. It seemed pretty clear where to start.<br>DOCTOR: So... how have you been?<br>TEGAN: Like you care.<br>ACE: Tegan, we discussed this.<br>TEGAN: Thirty eight years!<br>YASMIN: I'm Yaz. The only one here who doesn't really know what's going on.<br>TEGAN: We used to be you, decades back.<br>YASMIN: Oh. I see. Wow.<br>DOCTOR: So what was so urgent, Kate?<br>KATE: This is why I brought you in. Let's start with the paintings. Mona Lisa, The Scream, The Hay Wain, Girl With A Pearl Earring, The Last Supper. All of them and more taken out of public view because all of them, we've discovered, have been defaced. The face of Rasputin inserted into every painting.<br>DOCTOR: Oh no, that's not Rasputin. That's the Master.<br>ACE + TEGAN: What?<br>MASTER [on screen]: Greetings, seismology fans. If you're craving answers to life's little mysteries, my keynote address at the International Seismology Memorial Conference is now starting at a conference hall vaguely near you. Come feel the Earth move. Here's the pin. See you in a bit.<br>ACE: So that's the Master now? 1916, Rasputin, and the only person who would leave a Tardis that looked like mine.<br>YASMIN: Hotel. 3.2 kilometres from Mount Vesuvius.<br>KATE: We've got a UNIT base near Naples. I'll get you local support.<br>DOCTOR: Sorry, dealing with multiple somethings. It's good to see you both.<br>TEGAN: Ow! You gave me an electric shock.<br>DOCTOR: Sorry. My bad. I promise, I'm coming back.<br>ACE: Ow! Oh, you are really staticky.<br>(Quick scan with the sonic.)<br>DOCTOR: We'll be back. Come on, Yaz.<br>TEGAN: I think I handled that quite well.</p><p><b>[Naples]</b></p><p>MASTER: If we correlate the latest tremor detection data with the aforementioned ground deformation measurements, cross-referencing the increase in volcanic gas emissions and rising magma levels, we note...<br>YASMIN: Doctor, look.<br>MASTER: ..ladies and gentlemen, that it would only take the slightest tectonic pressure...(waves) Do you like my seismologist collection? I think I've got the whole set now.<br>DOCTOR: All right, I followed your breadcrumb trail. Some people think you're Rasputin, you've got a Tardis on a metal planet with a stolen Qurunx, guarded by your Cyber Masters in 1916. Now, do I win a prize if I guess how this all fits together or are you just going to tell me why you're grandstanding?<br>MASTER: Be patient. We'll get there.<br>DOCTOR: How did you even escape from Gallifrey?<br>MASTER: Magnificent attention to detail. I'm a seismologist now.<br>YASMIN: You killed all these people. For what?<br>MASTER: To give you simple, fair warning. Leave Earth now, Doctor, or it will be the death of you, because really, honestly, truly, this is the day you die. No, not just die. This is the day you are erased from existence... forever. I know, a bit of a conversation stopper. Awkward, right, Yaz? Do you see what I've done? I was so clever because I can give her this warning, but we both know she won't leave. She can't, not now I've said that to her, and yet she knows she should, because she also knows I don't make empty threats. I can absolutely, categorically, pinky-promisey confirm this is no empty threat.<br>SOLDIERS: Go! Go! Go! Go!<br>MASTER: Ooo, ooo! You brought soldiers. Are these for me? Oh, you shouldn't have. Is this rendition? I've always wanted to be renditioned. Or is it rendered? Ooo, gentle, gentle, gentle, boys! Am I going to UNIT? I hope I'm going to UNIT.<br>DOCTOR: Give her a gun.<br>YASMIN: What?<br>DOCTOR: Cover him. We're taking him in the Tardis. Take the gun.<br>MASTER: Yaz, she must be worried. Thought she didn't like guns.<br>YASMIN: Fine.<br>MASTER: Do you even know how to use that, love?<br>YASMIN: Don't you worry, I've had weapons training. Now move.<br>MASTER: Great chat. Good meeting. Thank you all. Clear up the tiny bodies and inform the loved ones for me, would you?</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>MASTER: You're not going to shoot me. Not in her Tardis. Think of the mess.<br>YASMIN: Just in case you're wondering, all this I'm-messing-with-your-mind chat, I've heard worse on a Friday night in Sheffield.<br>MASTER: Can I let you in on a little secret? It's okay, it's okay. I ingested the Cyberium. The battle AI of the Cybermen. I'm so many steps ahead. I can see it all, right through to all our ends. I'm sorry, Yaz, this is going to be very, very painful.<br>YASMIN: In your dreams, mate.<br>MASTER: Yeah.<br>DOCTOR: UNIT will keep you under armed guard, while I get rid of all the mess you've been scattering around the place.<br>MASTER: Whatever you want. I'm in her head. I said I'm in your head, dear. Aren't those Dalek symbols? What are they, coordinates? Why... why are you getting messages from Daleks? Why is she getting messages from Daleks?<br>YASMIN: I'm sure there's a good reason.<br>MASTER: Let's hope so.</p><p><b>[Spaceship]</b></p><p>VINDER: Status report. Inston-Vee Vinder now exiting the wormhole. I've survived, and I'm detecting a life signal from the missing Qurunx, but the wormhole is playing havoc with the ship. In summary, wormhole navigation was a really bad idea!<br>(Crash.)</p><p><b>[Cyberplanet]</b></p><p>VINDER: Okay, let's start with the good news. The ship did accurately predict the wormhole and managed to surf it with me inside. Good news part two. It did lead me to the missing Qurunx, so I guess we could say mission partially successful? Except... apparently it's connected to some control system on a planet that shouldn't even be here, according to the charts. Oh, and I have a ship problem in that it's broken. Thanks, wormhole. Wait.<br>(He sees a Tardis.)</p><p><b>[UNIT HQ]</b></p><p>KATE: Put him in the bunker. Constant monitoring, full security detail.<br>MASTER: Ooo, the bunker! That sounds nice. I love a bunker. Anybody want to join me? Bunk-up in the bunker? Your dad was an idiot. Oh, Tegan Jovanka! How's your Auntie Vanessa? Do you keep her in a little doll's house?<br>TEGAN: I'm going to enjoy watching you locked up in a tiny cell.<br>MASTER: That's right, you tell me. And Ace! Or should I say Dorothy? Didn't the Doctor ditch you? No? Little fallout with your Machiavellian maestro?<br>ACE: Last time I saw you, you were half cat.<br>MASTER: A man's allowed to experiment.<br>KATE: Take him away.<br>MASTER: Yes, yes, take me away. You'll all feel safer then with me in the building. You're not staying, Doctor? You're not going to leave them alone, are you, while you go Dalek hunting? Whoo!<br>DOCTOR: Ace, Tegan, I need you to stay here and monitor the Master. We won't be long.<br>ACE: Professor, where are you going?<br>TEGAN: She really doesn't want us back in there.</p><p><b>[Bunker]</b></p><p>MASTER: Wow. Love what you've done with the place. Darling, I don't seem to have the room-service menu, only I have allergies. I'm human-intolerant. No? Just trying to lighten the tone before you all die.</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>YASMIN: Doctor. Stop for a second. I can't keep doing this with you, running from one place to the next, never explaining.<br>DOCTOR: Sorry, no time.<br>YASMIN: Make time. Daleks... on the same day as the Master and Cybermen.<br>DOCTOR: I know. They're either separate problems, or all part of one bigger scheme. He doesn't have that power. He couldn't corral Daleks and Cybermen, could he? It's all happening so fast. Ooo! Very sorry. I am really staticky today.<br>YASMIN: You're going to meet a Dalek. Has it never occurred to you that it could be a trap?<br>DOCTOR: Of course it has. But there's about to be a Dalek attack on Earth, and the one that tipped me off said it has information which could help us stop the Daleks, but not just now, all Daleks for ever. It's a calculated risk, and it's one I have to take.</p><p><b>[Bolivia - in a volcano]</b></p><p>YASMIN: I'll take down there. Meet you back here. Be careful.<br>DOCTOR: I'm supposed to be the one saying that to you.<br>(The Dalek transmats in.)<br>DALEK: I am surprised, Doctor. I was not sure you would come.<br>DOCTOR: Well, I did. Now give me the information you promised.<br>DALEK: All data is contained within my casing. You must be fast.<br>DOCTOR: This will extract all the information. You're really going to let me do this?<br>DALEK: I am. Data transfer in progress. I have betrayed my species. You must ensure they are destroyed.<br>(Meanwhile, with Yasmin.)<br>DALEK 2 [OC]: Testing complete. All systems are in place and operating at maximum efficiency. We are ready.<br>YASMIN: No. They're already here. Seismology. Volcanoes. Daleks. And the Master. No, this is not good news.</p><p><b>[UNIT HQ]</b></p><p>ACE: I'll get surveillance up on the Master's cell. We can take turns watching. Whatever he's up to, he can't do much from a UNIT prison cell. I really thought I'd seen the last of him.<br>TEGAN: Ace? The toy.<br>MASTER [on screen]: Oh! Didn't it want to stay inside your bag? Oh Tegan, do you really think the Doctor cared enough to send you even one meagre toy?<br>TEGAN: How's he doing that?<br>MASTER [on screen]: The Doctor didn't send you that, I did, knowing what you would do with it. You'd keep it so close to you because you have nothing else. Do you know the great thing about tissue compression? It also works in reverse. That ain't just any Cyberman. It's a Russian doll.<br>(That grows, then splits open and out walk more Cybermen.)<br>MASTER [on screen]: Oh, and say hello to my friend Ashad. I killed him once, but he's forgiven me now.<br>ACE: Tegan!<br>(Tegan tips over a table to use as a shield while Ace hand her a gun from a cubby hole in the floor.)<br>ACE: Gold bullets, tin-heads. Did you think UNIT wouldn't be ready?<br>TEGAN: Why isn't it working?<br>ASHAD: We long ago developed resistance to gold.<br>BOTH: Run!<br>MASTER [on screen]: Oh, run! Run! Oh, look at them.<br>KATE [OC]: All units, full combat protocols. UNIT is under attack. I repeat, UNIT is under attack from Cybermen.</p><p><b>[Bunker]</b></p><p>(Ashad frees the Master.)<br>MASTER: I am so glad I cloned you. Every detail paying off. Such a good plan.</p><p><b>[Volcano]</b></p><p>DALEK: Data transfer almost complete. We are detected!<br>DALEK 2: Stay where you are, Doctor. You have no escape.<br>DOCTOR: Was this your plan? To lure me in and then betray me?<br>DALEK: I did not betray you.<br>DALEK 2: The traitor speaks the truth. We allowed the traitor to contact you. Force opening of traitor.<br>(The Dalek's casing is opened to reveal the mutant.)<br>DALEK 2: Exterminate the traitor.<br>DALEKS: Exterminate!<br>DALEK 2: Enter the casing, Doctor.<br>DOCTOR: No.<br>DALEK 2: Obey!<br>DALEK 3: Obey!<br>DALEK 2: Or be exterminated!<br>(The tendrils drag the Doctor inside the casing as Yasmin watches.)<br>DALEK 2: Mission successful. The Doctor is a prisoner of the Daleks. Activate spatiotemporal shift.<br>(The Doctor is transmatted away.)</p><p><b>[Tardis]</b></p><p>YASMIN: I can do this. I can do this.<br>(The Cloister bell tolls.)<br>YASMIN: The Doctor's in danger. There must be a Dalek teleport trace that we can follow, that you can lock on to. And why am I talking to you?</p><p><b>[Winter Palace]</b></p><p>MASTER: Hello, Doctor. Welcome to the end of your existence. Say hello to my friends. I believe we're all acquainted, right? Do you like the garb? I love the garb. Got to dress for the occasion. I was just thinking we could call this the Master's Dalek Plan. Or the, er... Cyber-Dalek Master Plan, or the Cyber-Master's Dalek Plan? I can't quite get it. But in the end I suppose we'll just call it the day I killed the Doctor... with a little help from my friends.<br>DOCTOR: Your friends? You hate each other.<br>MASTER: And the one thing stronger than their hatred for each other... is their hatred for you. Just took a little handsome genius to point it out to them. What unites us is stronger than what divides us. I mean, that's very you, that, isn't it? You love a team, don't you? Letting every Tom, Dick and Harriet into your Tardis. Well, you have your fam. Now, I have mine.<br>DOCTOR: So everything else was a diversion?<br>MASTER: No. No. No! Not a diversion. Very important! Three-phase plan. You'll see. Except you won't. But rest assured, without you to defend it, Earth will fall very, very fast. I did warn you, Doctor. I'm going old-school, Doctor. A tribute to our elders. Do you remember the ultimate sanction for breaking our laws? Forced regeneration. They even did it to you once, didn't they? Well, maybe more than once. Who knows?

Well, you did it.<br>DOCTOR: Where is everyone?<br>YASMIN: I took them home.<br>DOCTOR: Did you? That's clever.<br>YASMIN: Well, Croydon, so close enough.<br>(Sarah Jane Smith's home town.)<br>DOCTOR: How long was I out?<br>YASMIN: A while.<br>DOCTOR: Why's the Cloister Bell ringing?<br>YASMIN: Doctor, look at your hand.<br>DOCTOR: No. No. That's not right. I need more time. I want more time! Ah! You know what this means, right? Yeah? It's all right. It's all right, Yaz. One last trip. Where would you choose? What flavour ice cream?</p><p><b>[Tardis roof]</b></p><p>(Eating ice cream cones.)<br>YASMIN: How many times do you think you've saved Earth?<br>DOCTOR: I've lost count. But look at it. How could you not love a planet like that?<br>YASMIN: I don't want it to end.<br>DOCTOR: A wise person once said to me, goodbyes only hurt because what came before was so special. Oh, and it's been so special. You, and Graham, and Ryan, and Dan. Nobody else got to be us. Nobody else got to live our days. Nobody. And my hearts are so full of love of all of you.

I mean, I had the most amazing adventures, really. I mean, you wait till you hear, cause I'm going to tell you 'em all. But... But I came back, and I actually can't tell anyone, because they'd have me put away. And that's... That started me thinking, though. I can't be the only one. I can't. And look! I'm not.<br>(Circle of chairs - Ace, Yasmin, Tegan, empty chair for Sarah Jane?, Jo, Dan, Ian, Kate, Mel.)<br>GRAHAM: I reckon there are more people out there too.
